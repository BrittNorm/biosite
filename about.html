                    Vincent Cicchetti is a New York native born on June 10th, 1990 in the Bronx and grew up in later in Queens. 
                    He is the child of James Edward Cicchetti and Cheri Samantha Leto. His public education started in P.S.-41 
                    (Public School) from kindergarten to second grade, west middle island school district from third to fifth grade,
                     then finally sixth grade to twelfth grade was longwood school district of which he graduated from in 2008. 
                     Wanting to further his education he decided to pursue a degree in graphic design. This decision stemmed 
                     from his love of drawing and creativity. He started going to Briarcliff college in late 2009 of which he 
                     graduated with an Associates degree two years later. Vincent now recalls that going to college was a 
                     waste of his time due to the fact that he has not found a career in what he was studying for while laughing 
                     at the fact that the college he has attended has gone under due to legal issues and is now a brewery. 
                     When asked if he would like to further his career or his education, he chooses education. The current 
                     career he has is considered a dead end for him and he looks to take up gunsmithing classes. Throughout 
                     life he moved up and down long island switching careers as he went. Vincent considers himself as a 
                     jack-of-all trades with no career path. Working jobs like retail, contractor work, car sales, mechanic, 
                     security work, and is currently a delivery driver for Sherwin Williams.
